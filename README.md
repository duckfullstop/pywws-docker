You can test your weather station like this:

docker run –privileged myforest/pywws pywws-testweatherstation

Following Jim's example using ~/weather/data, you can gather data onto your local file system like this:

docker run –privileged myforest/pywws -v ~/weather/data:/var/data pywws-hourly /var/data
